      "What if I told you that nowadays cartoons are not for kids anymore? They never were actually because the art of drawing has nothing to do with age, it's only about making something new and making a difference as with every kind of art there is. Toy Story 4 doesn't break borders of imagination by its once revolutionary computer animation but it sure has a very pretty picture. The story is same as the premise of the third part of the franchise but only this time it deals with a much wider variety of topics: self-association in the society, loyalty, shattering of dreams, search for your purpose in life, definition of friendship, dissatisfaction with your current life status and the list goes on. Kids are only looking for fun and jokes to keep them entertained and they will not be entertained by Toy Story 4 what I clearly saw sitting in the movie theater - this is a movie that has grown with its viewers and is almost a quarter of a century old now. All in all this is a sweet, touching, meaningful, thought-provoking story and is a worthy addition to the franchise that I would gladly be coming back to along with all of its three installments.\n",
